# Communications API
##### simplified interface for select functionalities of the ZeroMQ library

### Functionalities

| Transport modes | Communication modes |
| ---- | ---- |
| 1. inproc: in-process (inter-thread) <br>2. ipc: local inter-process | simple pub-sub only|

### Dependencies
+ ZeroMQ packages: (version 4.2.5)<br>
>sudo apt-get install libzmq3-dev
	+ (this should also install package libzmq5)
+ JSON-C packages:<br>
>sudo apt-get install libjson-c-dev
	+ (this should automatically install package libjson-c3)

this API is made to run in a Linux environment (originally written in Ubuntu 18.04.2)

>This library will be designed to be thread-safe with its intended use

## How to use

```c
#include <comms.h>
```

>find more details in [comms.h](https://github.com/sbroboticsteam/2019-2020-IARRC/blob/julie-comms-api/comms-api/include/comms.h)

### Functions
	
```c
int init_comms();
```
**!** call exactly once in every process, before calling any of the other comms functions<br>
this function initializes the ZeroMQ context for you
+ returns 0 on success, -1 on failure and sets errno accordingly

```c
void *init_node(char *config_path, topic_info_array_t *info_array);
```
 
**!** call exactly once in every node, before using publish() or subscribe()<br>
initializes the sockets for each topic
+ config_path: path to the config file for the node<br>
+ info_array: reference to a topic_info_array_t<br>
optional, for if you want to receive the config info in a struct
+ returns a node pointer on success, NULL on failure and sets errno accordingly.
>the returned pointer contains state information needed by the library functions<br>
>it should be sent as the last argument to publish() & subscribe()

```c
int publish(char *topic, void *msg, size_t size, int flags, void *node);
```
builds a zmq message and sends it on the specified topic
<br>drops the message if there are no connections on the specified topic
+ topic: name of the topic to send a message on
+ msg: message to send
+ size: size of the message in bytes
+ flags: set flag COMMS_NONBLOCKING to make function non-blocking
+ node: pointer returned by init_node
+ returns 0 on success, -1 on failure and sets errno accordingly
```c
msg_t *subscribe(char *topic, int flags, msg_t **msg, void *node);
```
listens for a message on the specified topic and returns a pointer to a received
message.
+ topic: name of the topic
+ flags: set flag COMMS_NONBLOCKING to make function non-blocking
+ msg: reference to a pointer whose value the function will change to point to the received message
+ node: pointer returned by init_node
+ returns a struct containing the received message and the message size, NULL on failure & sets errno accordingly
```c
void close_msg(msg_t *msg);
```
call to deallocate messages retrieved from subscribe() that are no longer needed

### Nodes
	
A node is an entity that needs to communicate with other entities. <br>
The only restriction is that one C thread can only correspond to one node. <br>
-> in other words, a node can be any individual thread.

### Config files

each node needs to have one JSON config file for all of its topics
##### Sample config file setup:
```
{
	"topics": [
		{
			"name":"topic-a",
			"role":"pub",
			"transport":"ipc",
			"address":"foo"
		},
		{
			"name":"topic-b",
			"role":"sub",
			"transport":"inproc",
			"address":"bar"
		}
	]
}
```
### Topics

A topic is a channel on which nodes can communicate
 
>	Topics can be either *ipc* or *inproc*<br>
		- an ipc topic is for communication between nodes that are each in separate processes<br>
		- an inproc topic is for communication between nodes that are all in the same process

>	All topics are in the pub/sub model<br>
		- each topic must have exactly 1 node in the publisher role
		- the publisher can publish messages, and all subscribers receive all messages

> Every node in a topic must include the topic in their config file

In the config file, a topic has 4 fields:

	name: a name for the user to identify the topic. 

	role: "pub" or "sub"
			"pub": means the node publishes on that topic
			"sub": means the node subscribes to that topic

	transport: "ipc" or "inproc"

	address: a topic's address can be any string
			*two ipc topics cannot have the same address
			*two inproc topics in the same process cannot have the same address
			for ipc, the address becomes a file in /tmp/comms/
